# Reddit-Social-Media-Toolkit
Full-stack no-framework web application for tracking and engagement with Reddit as social media advertising.

This is the largest project I worked on during my time in college, where I worked as the Project Manager/DevOp developer with 3 teammates. It was built with the intention of having 4 separate servers running together, virtualized using AWS and duplicated to have 3 stacks (dev, QC, and production) with an external deployment server to manage the pushing and rollback of new software between each layer/server. Currently there is no demo for this project, but that is a work in progress.
